## 4. CICD
### Jenkins Pipeline: Build, Push, and Deploy (GitLab → DockerHub → Kubernetes)

Below is a guideline to configure a Jenkins pipeline that will:
1. **Clone source code from GitLab**
2. **Build and push the Docker image to DockerHub**
3. **Deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster**

#### 1. Prerequisites

- Jenkins server running, with Docker, kubectl, and Helm installed.
- Jenkins **GitLab** plugin installed.
- Jenkins credentials set up:
  - **GitLab**: Username/Password or Personal Access Token (as a secret)
  - **DockerHub**: Username/Password (as a DockerHub credential in Jenkins)
  - **Kubeconfig** for cluster deployment (as a secret file credential)
- Jenkins agent/runner has access to Docker daemon.
- Proper context/namespace access for kubectl/helm on the Jenkins host.

![Jenkins_dashboard](images/jenkins_dashboard.png)

#### 2. Example Jenkins Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`)

This file defines the automation stages for building, testing, packaging, and deploying the ML model service using Jenkins. The typical pipeline in this `Jenkinsfile` includes:
- **Test Stage:** Runs unit tests and validates dependencies by installing requirements and executing tests (usually using `pytest`).
- **Build Stage:** Builds a Docker image of the service and tags it with the Jenkins build number, preparing it for deployment.
- **Push Stage:** Authenticates with DockerHub (using stored Jenkins credentials) and pushes both the versioned and `latest` tags of the Docker image to the DockerHub registry.
- **Deploy Stage:** Uses Kubernetes and Helm inside a containerized environment to deploy or upgrade the service on a target Kubernetes cluster based on the latest image.

It also manages retention of build logs and incorporates timestamps for better build traceability. Credentials for DockerHub and any Kubernetes operations are managed securely via Jenkins credentials and secrets.  
To use the pipeline, create a `Jenkinsfile` in your project’s root directory and commit it to your repository.

## 5. Observable System
### Using ELK Stack for Observability
To monitor and observe logs from your ML serving system, you can deploy an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana).
The ELK stack helps aggregate logs, search through them efficiently, and visualize metrics in real time. Here’s how it fits into the MLOps pipeline:
- **Elasticsearch:** Stores and indexes logs from containers, Kubernetes pods, and other sources.
- **Logstash:** Collects, processes, and forwards logs from various sources into Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana:** Visualizes logs and metrics from Elasticsearch, providing dashboards for rapid troubleshooting and analytics.

### Deploy ELK
Run command: `docker compose -f deployment/elk/elk-docker-compose.yml -f deployment/elk/extensions/filebeat/filebeat-compose.yml up -d`

#### ELK Stack Setup Instructions
This project includes a pre-configured ELK stack for local observability and log analysis. You can deploy the ELK stack using the provided Docker Compose file.

**Steps to use ELK from `deployment/elk/elk-docker-compose.yml`:**

1. **Prerequisites**  
   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your host machine.

2. **Start the ELK stack**  
   In the project root directory, run:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/elk/elk-docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```
   This will start the following services:
   - `elasticsearch` (data store & search engine)
   - `kibana` (dashboard UI)
   - `logstash` (log pipeline—optional configuration as needed)

3. **Access Kibana**  
   Once all containers are running, open your browser and navigate to:  
   [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)  
   Use Kibana to explore logs and set up dashboards.
![Grafana](images/grafana.png)

🔎 Real-time Log Streaming & Checking
To view logs in real time and monitor your services instantly, you can use built-in Docker log streaming or tools like Kibana's "Discover" tab. This setup lets you observe log output and troubleshoot your ML system as it runs.
    ![Stream Log in Real Time](images/stream_log.png)

#### Prometheus, Grafana & Jaeger Setup Instructions

This project includes a Docker Compose configuration for setting up observability and tracing using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and (optionally) **Jaeger**. This monitoring stack enables you to collect, monitor, and visualize performance metrics and traces from your ML service.

**Steps to use Prometheus & Grafana from `deployment/prom-graf-docker-compose.yaml`:**

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and available on your system.
   - The machine should have free ports: `9090` (Prometheus), `9100` (Node Exporter), `3000` (Grafana), `8090`, `8099`.

2. **Start the Monitoring Stack**  
   In your project root, run:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/prom-graf-docker-compose.yaml up -d
   ```
   This will spin up the following services:
   - `prometheus`: Metrics collection and alerting
   - `grafana`: Dashboard and visualization interface
   - `node-exporter`: Machine-level metrics
   - `cadvisor`: Container resource statistics
   - `alertmanager`: Alert management
   - `demo-metrics`: Example service being monitored

3. **Access Grafana and Prometheus Dashboards**
**Grafana:**  
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
![Grafana Dashboar](images/grafana.png)
**Prometheus:**  
Visit [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
AI Predict exposes log counts request via a metrics endpoint (`/predict`), Prometheus can scrape and show these values.Use the search bar to query metrics such as: `ai_request_counter_total` 
![Prom AI Service](images/prom_ai_service.png)

4. **Explore Node and Container Metrics**  
   - **Node Exporter** is available on [http://localhost:9100/metrics](http://localhost:9100/metrics)
   - **cAdvisor** UI is available at [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)
6. **Alerting**
   - Alertmanager and alert rules are configurable under `./prometheus/config/alert-rules.yml`.
7. **Tracing with Jaeger**
   - **Jaeger** is included in the stack for distributed tracing (see service `jaeger` in the compose file).
   - Jaeger collects and visualizes traces from your applications, helping you analyze request propagation and performance bottlenecks.
   - **Access the Jaeger UI** at: [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)
   - Explore traces, operations, and timing details for requests to the ML API, get service `ai-serving` 
   ![Jaeger UI](images/jager_ai_service.png)
